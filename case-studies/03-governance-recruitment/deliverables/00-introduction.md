# AI Fairness Implementation Playbook

## Introduction

This playbook provides a comprehensive framework for implementing fair AI systems in organizations. Developed through the EquiHire case study, it demonstrates how to integrate fairness considerations across the entire ML lifecycle—from team practices to regulatory compliance.

## Playbook Components

This playbook consists of six core components plus supporting materials:

### Core Requirements

   - Connects Fair AI Scrum, Governance, Architecture, and Compliance components
   - Defines workflows and information flows between components

2. **Implementation Guide** (`02_Implementation_Guide.md`)
   - Step-by-step instructions for using the playbook
   - Decision points, evidence requirements, and risk mitigation strategies

3. **Case Study: EquiHire** (`03_Case_Study_EquiHire.md`)
   - Practical demonstration of playbook application
   - Real metrics: 109.5% improvement in demographic parity
   - Multi-team coordination in EU-based recruitment platform

4. **Validation Framework** (`04_Validation_Framework.md`)
   - Metrics and checkpoints for success validation
   - Statistical validation methods (permutation tests, bootstrap CI)
   - Maturity assessment model

5. **Adaptability Guidelines** (`05_Adaptability_Guidelines.md`)
   - Domain adaptation (healthcare, finance, education, etc.)
   - Problem type variations (classification, regression, ranking)
   - Organizational scaling recommendations

6. **Future Improvements** (`06_Future_Improvements.md`)
   - Enhancement roadmap
   - Identified gaps and limitations
   - Continuous improvement recommendations

### Supporting Materials

7. **Gap Analysis** (`07_Gap_Analysis.md`)
   - Coverage analysis of playbook guidance
   - Implementation friction points
   - Enhancement backlog

8. **CEO Presentation** (`08_CEO_Presentation.md`)
   - Executive briefing format
   - Strategic implications and board-level asks
   - ROI analysis and risk assessment
